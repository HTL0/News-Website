#Hi, Iâ€™m HOANG THE LONG

This is News-Website with integrated todo list management feature

This project using HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, API from "newsapi.org"(defalut location is Japan), JAVASCRIPT(OOP and Asynchronous)

This project has the following features:

- 1.Register

- 2.Login

- 3.Get news

- 4.Setting news change category

- 5.Todo list management

I use developer Plan $0 CORS enabled for localhost https://newsapi.org/pricing 
with key API is "830b457d706743e9b3af3662d9c2bbf6"

So this API works only in local host.
You need to create a local host environment before testing "get news feature" of this website.
Or not 426 error will appear. sorry about that...
